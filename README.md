# Revium

Revium can find locations based on GoogleMap user ratings total.

## Description

The application is more focused on the number of reviews than on the rating.

Wouldn't you rather go to a restaurant with a rating of 3.5 but 100 reviews than to a restaurant with a rating of 4.5 but only 10 reviews?

So, unlike GoogleMap, this application can search for places in order of the number of reviews gathered.
